222  =To move freely in any direction without the need to turn, hold lk while dribbling. The deft touch dribble allows you to have close control of the ball using the sole of your foot.
This is particularly useful if you are trying to hold on to the ball while looking for openings or waiting for support to arrive.
223  =To outrun an opponent with a quick burst of speed, quickly press lj twice and ob in the desired direction.
224  =Whilst stationary, hold down lk and push jn in the desired direction to take a touch and set up the ball.
This allows you to subsequently pass or shoot with greater accuracy and power.
225  =To dribble, push ob when you have the ball, but if you release ob while on the run, your momentum will continue to carry you forward. If you want to come to a sudden stop, first release ob, then press lj.
226  =To come to a stop and immediately face the opposing goal, release ob, then press lk while you have the ball.
227  =When receiving a ball which is being played to you at speed, press lk as you trap the ball to absorb its momentum and exercise close control.
This is particularly useful when you are trying to receive the ball in a crowded area.
228  =To flick the ball up as soon as you trap it, you will need to press and hold jl prior to receiving the ball.
This is a skill which has many applications. It could be used as a means of escaping a marker who is coming in from behind when receiving the ball or as a means to set up a powerful strike.
229  =To turn towards the opposing goal as you trap the ball, release ob, then hold lk prior to receiving the ball.
230  =To trick an opponent into thinking you are going to receive the ball, release ob, then hold li and lj before the ball gets to your feet. If there is an unmarked player who is running in behind you, you can use this trick to create confusion among the defense, which can then be exploited.
231  =To play a low pass, press lb. If you want to play a pass to a more distant teammate, hold lb for longer.
232  =To play a lofted pass, press la. If you want to play a pass to a more distant teammate, hold la for longer.
233  =Press la while holding lk to play a high pass.

236  =To cross the ball, press la when you are on the ball in a wide position.
To hit a low cross along the ground, quickly press la twice. For a high cross, press la while holding lk.
237  =If you are running with the ball and looking to exploit the space between the opposition goalkeeper and his defence, try hitting an early cross by pressing la while holding li.
238  =Press lc to shoot. The longer you hold lc, the greater the elevation. Accuracy and power when shooting can also be influenced by factors such as the speed you are running when shooting on the run or the distance of the run up you took before striking the ball.
239  =If you need additional accuracy when shooting press lc while holding lk.
Controlled shots sacrifice power for accuracy, but tend to be harder for goalkeepers to save.
240  =To go for a delicate chip, press lc while holding li.
If you see that the goalkeeper is off his line, try lobbing the ball over his head and into an empty net.
241  =To hit a wobbling shot which takes an unpredictable flight towards goal, press lc once to set the power level, then press lc again just as you are about to strike the ball.

247  =The manual shot which you can take by pressing ll when shooting is designed to give you full control of both the direction and the power you put behind your effort on goal.
Aiming guides showing the direction the ball is likely to travel can be turned ON/OFF in Personal Data → Support Settings.
248  =Press lb while holding li to make a player pass the ball and immediately start a run toward the opposing goal. Before the ball reaches its intended target, release ob, then press ld or li + ld to make the ball receiver play a return pass, thus completing the one-two.
249  =Press lb while holding li to play the initial pass. 
You can then make the player who started the move run in any direction you choose by pushing jn while still holding li.
250  =Press lk when passing to make the player run towards the opposition goal on completing his pass.
251  =To make your teammate run towards the opposition goal, hold li then push jn towards the intended player. Releasing jn subsequently will make the player start his run.

257  =Press lb while the goalkeeper has the ball in his hands to make him throw it.
The longer you hold lb, the further the ball will travel.
258  =Press ld while the goalkeeper has the ball in his hands to make him throw it into open space.
The longer you hold ld, the further the ball will travel.
259  =Press la while the goalkeeper has the ball in his hands to make him kick it up the pitch.
The longer you hold la, the further the ball will travel.
260  =Press lb just as the goalkeeper is about to kick or throw the ball to make him fake a pass.
261  =To instruct your teammates to attack, you must first use jn to select the player who will receive the ball.
You do this by pushing jn while holding li towards the direction of the intended player, then release jn. To deselect the player, press li again.
262  =Once you have chosen the player who will be receiving the ball using li + jn, you as the goalkeeper can instruct your teammates to pass the ball to him by pressing either la,lb or ld. If no ball receiver was selected in advance, the COM will pass the ball automatically to the player deemed most appropriate.
*To select the player to receive the ball press li + jn, and to deselect, press li.
263  =If you want your teammates to pass the ball back to you, press lb. This can only be done if the ball is in your own half and there are no selected ball receivers.

268  =When chasing an opponent who is on the ball, you can jostle by holding lj and lf.
269  =Press le to perform a Sliding Tackle and slide towards the feet of an opponent who is on the ball. If you time it right, you can steal the ball, potentially setting up a dangerous counter attack.
270  =Whenever the ball is in your own half, you can punt the ball away from goal by pressing lc.
It is a useful defensive move when there are no safe ways to try and play the ball out from deep.

*This does not apply when the goalkeeper cannot use his hands, such as with back passes from teammates.
278  =To instruct your teammate to apply pressure on an opposition player who is on the ball, press lg.
279  =When playing matches with the Fixed Cursor setting on, you can give general instructions to your outfield players while controlling just just one player.

312  =When taking a penalty, the amount of power in your shot depends on how long you press lc or in other words, how much you build up the power gauge.
Weaker penalties tend to have better placement while going for power leads to reduced accuracy.
313  =To take a chipped penalty, press lc while holding li. This is the perfect way to show up a goalkeeper who has already decided which way to dive.
314  =When facing a penalty, you can adjust the goalkeeper's position by pushing ob toward the desired direction up to the moment the penalty kick taker strikes the ball.
315  =A goalkeeper stands a decent chance of saving a powerfully struck penalty if you guess right by pushing ob in the direction you want before the ball is struck. However, this technique doesn't work so well against penalty takers who deliberately take weak shots to disrupt your rhythm and make you commit early.
316  =A player may sometimes choose to go for placement over power when taking a penalty. In such cases, the keeper can quite comfortably pull off a save by pushing ob to dive after the ball has been struck. However, this doesn't work well against powerful strikes where committing early is the key to making a save.
317  =When an opponent who is chasing you tries to get a grab of you, push jn in his direction to spread your arms and hold him off.
318  =Quickly tap lf twice to perform a tackle on an opposition player.
